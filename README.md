# Management System

## About the Project
This project is a small Proof of Concept (POC) developed by me and my team during our learning phase. It was designed to address the challenges faced by clients in managing their freelancers. The project was created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, reflecting our journey of learning and experimentation.

## Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory:
    ```
    cd client
    ```
2. Start the client application:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
3. Open another terminal window/tab and navigate to the server directory:
    ```
    cd ../server
    ```
4. Install server dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
5. Start the server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

Expect surprises as the project reflects our learning experiences and may include unconventional approaches or solutions.
